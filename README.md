# React UI Component Assignment - Uzence

This project was created as part of the front-end internship assignment. It includes two custom-built React components: an InputField and a DataTable, documented with Storybook.

## My Approach

I built both components from scratch using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS as required. 

- **InputField**: I focused on creating a flexible component by managing its different states (disabled, invalid, loading), variants, and sizes through props and conditional styling.
- **DataTable**: I used React hooks like `useState` and `useMemo` to efficiently handle client-side sorting and row selection, ensuring the component is performant.
